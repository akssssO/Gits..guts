# 🏁 Burnout Datathon: MotoGP Lap Time Prediction

## 🚀 What’s This About?
This repo is where I tackled the **Burnout Datathon**—a MotoGP lap time prediction challenge. The goal? Build a machine learning model that accurately predicts lap times based on rider stats, track conditions, and tire choices.

After rounds of fine-tuning, I landed on a **LightGBM model** that pulled off a **validation RMSE of 10.0354** 🎯

## 📊 The Plan
### 🔍 **Feature Engineering**
To give the model more to work with, I engineered a few key features:
- **`podium_rate`** → How often a rider finishes on the podium (`podiums / starts`)
- **`win_rate`** → Race wins per start (`wins / starts`)
- **`finish_rate`** → Races finished cleanly (`finishes / starts`)
- **`lap_complexity`** → Tracks with tighter corners vs. speed (`Corners_per_Lap / Avg_Speed_kmh`)

### 🏎️ **The Model Choice**
Went with **LightGBM**, tuned for speed and accuracy:
- **1000 estimators** (with early stopping at 50 rounds)
- **Learning rate:** `0.05`
- **Num leaves:** `31`
- **Eval metric:** RMSE  

## 📈 How’d It Do?
- ✅ **Validation RMSE:** `10.0354`
- ✅ **Leaderboard Submission:** `solution3.csv`
- ✅ **File checks:** Unique IDs intact, no missing values
